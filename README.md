#### 16 . [semaphoreci Status Badges](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/essentials/status-badges/)

create a badge that displays your project's current build status. The build status is determined by the status of the first pipeline in your newest workflow. You can use this badge in your project's README file or any web page.

📍 For example :

<img alt="semaphore docs" src="https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/badges/docs/branches/master.svg">
